**Mr Mannequins Tools is a [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on that exports animations and weighted meshes that are directly compatible with the third person mannequin in Unreal Engine, without re-targeting anything... As if that wasn't useful enough, it also has several mannequin themed template meshes and armatures that are ready for you to animate and block out your projects with!**

*This is a free project so please do not anticipate dedicated individual help unless you are supporting me financially. I will help where i can but only when i have the time.*
