## Mr Mannequins Tools Licensing

Mr Mannequins Tools is a Blender add-on concieved and written by James Goldsworthy (Jim Kroovy).

There are three licenses to be considered when using this add-on, see below.

Both GNU GPL 3.0 and CC BY 4.0 licenses are provided in the repository even though only the GNU GPL 3.0 license would be relevant to it as the .blend files are are only stored in the release .zips to avoid using Git LFS.

You should already have a copy of the UE4 EULA if you are planning to use this add-on so i have not included it as a text file.

**GNU GPL 3.0**

- All Python scripts used in Blender add-ons must have a GNU GPL compatible license. All the python scripting in the add-on(s) has a GNU GPL 3.0 License.
- See [Sharing or selling Blender add-ons (Python scripts)](https://www.blender.org/about/license/) and [GNU GPL - 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
- "Blenderâ€™s Python API is an integral part of the software, used to define the user interface or develop tools for example. The GNU GPL license therefore requires that such scripts (if published) are being shared under a GPL compatible license. You are free to sell such scripts, but the sales then is restricted to the download service itself. Your customers will receive the script under the same license (GPL), with the same free conditions as everyone has for Blender."
- *So you can do anything you like with my Python scripts but credit is still greatly appreciated.*

**UE4 EULA**
```python
# Included with this add-on(s) in the "_resources_" folder are the 
# "Mannequin.blend" and the "Gun.blend" and the meshes and textures
# contained/used by them are property of Epic Games and should come
# under the UE4 EULA <https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula>.
#
# I have not included this license as a .txt as you should already
# have a copy of it and will of agreed to it when downloading UE4.
```
- All the third person mannequin and first person gun meshes and textures and anything created with them should come under the UE4 EULA. (Unreal Engine - End User License Agreement) 
- See the [Unreal Engine End User License Agreement](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula)
- The basic idea is that you can use the mannequin/first person gun however you want as long as it's use is related to Unreal Engine.
- There is little point including the UE4 EULA as text with the add-on as you should already have a copy of it if you plan on using this add-on.
- Credit to Jim Kroovy and Mr Mannequins Tools for the Blender side rigging and materials is appreciated but not required under the CC BY license.

**CC BY 4.0**
```python
# Any .blend files included with this add-on(s) in the "_resources_" folder
# and any armatures, meshes, materials and textures contained within them that
# do not fall under the UE4 EULA (see above for specific files)
# are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
#
# You should have received a copy of the license along with this
# work. If not, see <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>.

- All .blend files and their mesh, armature, material, texture and action contents (provided they do not already come under the UE4 EULA) and anything created with them have a CC-BY license. (Creative Commons - Attribution) 
- See [Creative Commons - CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
- "All CC licenses require that others who use your work in any way must give you credit the way you request, but not in a way that suggests you endorse them or their use. If they want to use your work without giving you credit or for endorsement purposes, they must get your permission first."
- "This license allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator. The license allows for commercial use."
- *Attribution conditions*
  - Do whatever you want with the .blend files and their contents but if you upload or distribute them (or any derivatives of them) you must give me credit. 
  - If you need special permissions please ask. I frequently give permission for people using my creations to create online storefront assets. For example the UE4 Marketplace will require me to alter permissions so that while the creator must credit me, people who purchase the created asset(s) do not have to.
  - To give credit you must visibly state that the specific file(s) or add-on(s) that created them was provided by Jim Kroovy and (if possible) provide links to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/JimKroovy) and/or [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JimKroovy).
